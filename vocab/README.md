# Personal Location Data Ontology

## Concept scheme

A [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) concept scheme about transport modes can be found [here](./vocab.ttl).

TODO:
* there is still a need for a requesting access ontology (maybe solid general)

## Examples

Examples using the SSN/SOSA ontology to describe personal location observations. Location observations also have metadata about the mode of transport mode using the above concept scheme.

* [An example about a single location data point using SSN/SOSA](./examples/location_ssn.ttl)
